# Dotfiles

This is a collection of dotfiles that I use. Configurations currently included are:

- vim
- git

There is also a setup script `.setup/setup.sh` that can be ran to quick-start a new machine. Alternatively, individual setup scripts can be ran.

The `.setup/update-plugins.sh` script can be ran to update dependencies after pulling from master.
