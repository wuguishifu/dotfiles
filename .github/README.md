# Dotfiles

This is a collection of dotfiles that I use. Configurations currently included are:

- vim
- git
- zsh

There is also a setup script `.setup/setup` that can be ran to quick-start a new machine. Alternatively, individual setup scripts can be ran.

The `.setup/update-plugins` script can be ran to update dependencies after pulling from master.

If you want to include the zsh extension, you can run the `.setup/configure-zsh` script.
